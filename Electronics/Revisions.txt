Revisions Needed:
------------------------------------------------

Main board:
*RX/TX from USB-UART bridge connected to RX/TX on ESP32 respectively, should be connected to TX/RX on ESP32 respectively.
*SDO from ESP32 connected to SDO on DAC. Should be connected to SDI on DAC.
*LED connected to IMU Interupt 1 not needed.
*C11 & R14 Designators need position swapped.
*XT60 battery connectors wrong polarity. Can be installed on bottom of board for temporary relief.
*Recommend PTC fuses on motor outputs for current limiting over time. Protects motor from being burned out. 
*Terminals used for motor outputs rather small. Recommend larger terminal or connector, perhaps XT30
*Excessive audible ringing heard during USB transfers. Needs investigation.
*With button, switch, and LED functions now defined, silkscreen labels are in order.
*Battery voltage cutoff circutry would be very nice to have.
*Fan Header(s) for cooling motor amplifiers would be nice to have.



Motor Amplifier:
*Feedback resistors not matched well to avalible values. Recommend calibration potentiometer to alieviate software calibration necessity.


Other:
*Custom Board for IMU could reduce size and improve wiring connection.
*If pursuing commercial board, smaller components and double sided board would be appropriate. Perhaps integrated amplifiers, rather than daughter cards.
*USB-C would be welcome modernization
